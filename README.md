Introduction to SQL
Welcome to SQLBolt, a series of interactive lessons and exercises designed to help you quickly learn SQL right in your browser.

What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

For example, if the Department of Motor Vehicles had a database, you might find a table containing all the known vehicles that people in the state are driving. This table might need to store the model name, type, number of wheels, and number of doors of each vehicle for example.

In such a database, you might find additional related tables containing information such as a list of all registered drivers in the state, the types of driving licenses that can be granted, or even driving violations for each driver.

By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data, like "What types of vehicles are on the road have less than four wheels?", or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?", to help us make better decisions down the road.

About the lessons
Since most users will be learning SQL to interact with an existing database, the lessons begin by introducing you to the various parts of an SQL query. The later lessons will then show you how to alter a table (or schema) and create new tables from scratch.

Each lesson will introduce a different concept and end with an interactive exercise. Go at your pace and don't be afraid to spend time experimenting with the exercises before continuing! If you happen to be familiar with SQL already, you can skip ahead using the links in the top-right, but we would recommend you work through the lessons anyways!
